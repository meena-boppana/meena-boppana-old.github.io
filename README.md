## Mathematics Tutor

As a lifelong math lover, Meena found her passion in teaching mathematics. She relishes breaking down a complex concept and celebrating the “a-ha” moments when a student truly gets it. Meena was on the mathematics faculty at Boston’s Commonwealth School, teaching advanced courses spanning Calculus, Statistics, and Computer Science. She earned her M.Ed from the Harvard Graduate School of Education and her A.B. in computer science from Harvard College. 

An avid problem solver, Meena earned national recognition for her qualification for the USA Math Olympiad at age 16. As a student representing New York at national competitions, Meena was at times the only girl in the room. Meena established the student organization Harvard University Gender Inclusivity in Math as an undergraduate and currently works with the Math Prize for Girls competition. She is passionate about helping students of all backgrounds gain confidence in math.

Meena has experience working with students across grades 6-12.  Her approach is patient yet rigorous with a focus on conceptual understanding over drilling and formulas. She also designs customized enrichment courses for those looking to get ahead.
